This paper presents a novel account of the syntax and semantics of questions, making use of the framework for linguistic description developed by Richard Montague (\cite*{montague1974-selected-quantification}). Certain features of the proposal are based on work by N. Belnap (\cite*{belnap1963}), L. Ã…qvist (\cite*{aqvist1965}), C. L. Baker (\cite*{baker.c1968-thesis}, \cite*{baker.c1970-foundlang}), S. Kuno and J. Robinson (\cite*{kuno-robinson1972-li}), C. L. Hamblin (\cite*{hamblin1973-foundlang}), E. Keenan and R. Hull (\cite*{keenan-hull1973-petofi-franck}), J. Hintikka (\cite*{hintikka1974-munitz-unger}), Lewis (\cite*{lewis.d-lewis.s1975-theoria}), and D. Wunderlich (\cite*{wunderlich.d1976-fragesaetze}), but it differs from all of its predecessors in one way or another. I will start with a number of observations which provide the basis for the treatment of questions presented in the second part of the paper and conclude with a summary and a brief discussion of how the proposed description compares with recent transformational analyses.
