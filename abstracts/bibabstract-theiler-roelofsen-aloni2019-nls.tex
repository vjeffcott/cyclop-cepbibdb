It is a long-standing puzzle why predicates like \textit{believe} embed declarative but not interrogative complements (e.g., \textit{Bill believes that}/*\textit{whether Mary left}) and why predicates like wonder embed interrogative but not declarative complements (e.g., \textit{Bill wonders whether}/*\textit{that Mary left}). This paper shows how the selectional restrictions of a range of predicates (neg-raising predicates like \textit{believe}, truth-evaluating predicates like \textit{be true}, inquisitive predicates like \textit{wonder}, and predicates of dependency like \textit{depend on}) can be derived from semantic assumptions that can be independently motivated.
