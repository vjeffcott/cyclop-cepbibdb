The German modal verb \textit{wollen} (≈ \textit{want}) easily embeds reports of interrogative knowledge (\textit{know whether}), but is reluctant to take propositional knowledge reports (\textit{know that}) as complements. The difference is accounted for in terms of presupposition projection and a bridge principle relating desire reports and knowledge. The overall setting is a presuppositional extension of Groenendijk \& Stokhof’s (\cite*{groenendijk-stokhof1982-lingphil,groenendijk-stokhof1984-thesis}) partition semantics, as proposed by Sæbø (\cite*{saebo2007-tbillc}).
